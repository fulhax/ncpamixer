### Dependencies
* PulseAudio :alien:
* ncurses

### Build dependencies
* CMake
* C++14 compatible compiler
* Pandoc for `manpages`

On Debian(-based) systems, you'd need `libncurses-dev` and `libpulse-dev`.

### Building
* In the main directory, run `make`
* On some systems (tested on Debian-stable), you may need to instead run `make USE_WIDE=True`
* The above command is needed to get UTF-8 support; it will cause CMake to look for the ncursesw library, and it'll link to it with -lncursesw
* (This also means you might have to first `rm build/CMakeCache.txt` if you ran `make` without using the USE_WIDE setting, so it'll re-generate the Makefile)
